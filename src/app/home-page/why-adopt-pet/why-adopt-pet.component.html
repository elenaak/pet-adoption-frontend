                        An adopted pet is every bit as loving, intelligent and loyal as a purchased pet, even if you get
                        an
                        adult or older animal.
                        You are giving them a new life in a loving home and you get a new best friend out of the deal.
                        Seriously, what could be better than that?
                        Simply
                        put,
                        pets aren't just good friends; they're also good medicine and can improve a person's well-being
                        in
                        many ways.

                        Here you can find happy, healthy pets just waiting for someone to take
                        them home. Most of the pets wound up here because of a human problem like a move or a divorce,
                        not
                        because the animals did anything wrong. Many are already house-trained and used to living with
                        families.

                    <p style="color: cadetblue;">
                        Many of the pets from shelters and rescues are already house-trained, which means you’re not
                        only
                        saving a pet’s life, you may be saving your rug. Adopting a mature pet not only gives older
                        animals
                        a second chance, it often means introducing them to your family will be much easier.

                        Adopting animals from our site is FREE.
                        Usually when you adopt a pet from here , it is already spay/neuter, vaccinated (and sometimes
                        even
                        microchipped!), which can save you some of the up front costs of
                        adding a new member to your family. Depending on the animal, you may also save on housebreaking
                        and
                        training expenses.

                        Pets have a way of putting a smile on your face and a spring in your step. Not only do animals
                        give
                        you unconditional love, but research confirms that pets provide us humans with psychological,
                        emotional, and physical benefits. Caring for a companion animal can provide a sense of purpose
                        and
                        fulfillment as well as lessen feelings of loneliness and isolation in all age groups.
